    -can add null.
    -it follows insertion order.
    -No size limitations.
    -we can add another element once class loading is done.
    -it is not a thread safety, so it is fast.

    LINKED List
    -same as Array list.
    -memory consumption is more bcs it stores next and previous reference along with the data.
