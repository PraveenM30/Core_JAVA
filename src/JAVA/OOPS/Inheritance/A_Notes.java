    /*   Inheritance
        The process of acquiring the properties & behaviour of one class to another
        class using extend keyword.

        Key Points to Remember:
     1. extends keyword is used for inheritance between classes.
     2. Single inheritance only: a class can extend only one superclass.
     3. Method overriding allows modifying inherited methods.
     4. super keyword to access parent class methods/constructors/fields.
     5. Constructors are not inherited but can be invoked via super().
     6. Private members are not inherited but can be accessed indirectly via public/protected methods.

     Types
     1. single level -  a>b
     2.Multi level   -  a>b>c>d
     3.Multiple level  - c>a  & c>b  having multiple parents
     4.Hierarcheal level - b>a & c>a  one parent
     5.Hybrid - zig zag
